Kill objectives is to kill a certain number of enemies, it inherits from timed objective so it may or may not have a time limit.

Race objective is either for the player or some NPC to arrive at a location. It only relies on the focus for hte win condition to be
fulfilled so it can be used for escorting NPCs to certain locations. (It might be possible to adapt this to stop enemies from reaching
certain locations).

Survive objective is to not let the Focus die, which could be the player or some NPC.

There will be an array of objectives in MissionController (Not yet written) which should be completed one after another.
